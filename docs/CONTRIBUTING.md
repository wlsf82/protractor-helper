# Contributing

You can contribute in the following ways:

- Finding and reporting bugs
- Fixing bugs or implementing new features
- Improving the documentation
- Improving the code structure

## Steps to contribute

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your computer;
2. Install the dev dependencies using NPM: `npm install`;
3. Make the necessary changes and ensure that the tests are passing using `npm test` (implement new tests if needed);
4. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and I'll be happy to review it ðŸ™Œ;
5. Wait for feedback or approval (this should not take too long).

> Pull requests that do not pass the coding static analysis and the automated tests on [Github Actions](https://github.com/wlsf82/protractor-helper/actions), and the code quality verification on [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com/) will not be reviewed.

## Build status

After changes to master branch all tests are executed and the build status can be seen below.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/wlsf82/protractor-helper/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wlsf82/protractor-helper/actions)

## Code style

We use basic ESLint configuration as our coding style guide, together with Prettier.

Run `npm run lint` to lint source and test files.

Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix lint issues on source and test files.

## Tests

There are unit and end-to-end tests available to exercise the librariy's code.

For the unit tests, we use Jasmine.

For the end-to-end tests, we use Protractor and the protractor-helper lib itself, and a sample application using HTML, CSS, and JS is included in the repo in order for such tests to run against.

Run `npm t` to run the tests.

If all tests have passed you should see a result like this:

```sh
$ npm t
